* main chore

+ demote quadem from the default detector set to optional
+ perhaps rename the quadem channels Iq0, Iqt, Iqr
+ promote a set of icN detectors to the default detector set
+ point shortcuts (like "it" in linescan) at the new ICs

* metadata

+ need to set ~Detector.Ix~ correctly

* XDI

+ make good plot hint
+ right now, ic0 columns are just tacked on at the end.


* plotting

+ xafs sequence only tested with new IC as It
